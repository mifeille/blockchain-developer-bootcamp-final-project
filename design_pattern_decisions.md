### Design Patterns
* Access Control Design Pattern 
    I used access restiction method for example if the user who wants to buy the article does not have enough ether,
    they will not have access to that functionality. This restriction was implemented using modifiers.

* Upgradable Contracts
    My future plan is to use upgradable contracts so that I can be able to update my smart contracts.
    I have already started to use OpenZeppelin Upgrades to prevent my smart contract to be initialized multiple time,
    due to the lack of time I was not able to dig deeper into OpenZeppelin but I willl do it as I move on with this project.

* Iheritance and Interfaces
    As metioned above I have used OpenZeppelin Contracts library and I also created a library that every variable of string type
    can use, and the library checks if a string is a sub string of another string, 
    I plan to use this library for the search functionality of the project.
